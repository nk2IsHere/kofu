== Kofu

Kofu is a fork of Spring Fu project that aims to minimize the scope of original project to support only Kotlin, modularize
and make every module as slim as possible. This project also aims to maintain the parts of Spring Fu and update them to
support latest Spring versions.

This project has no relation to the development work done on the original Spring Fu project. It is not intended to be used
in production (although we do).

== Help needed

* kofu-webmvc tests fail on security

This project is a derivation from the original spring-fu project with no intention to become mainline.
Recently a lot of changes were introduced while migrating to Spring 3 - it is expected the stuff will be horribly broken.
Any help bringing Kofu up to a working level will be absolutely appreciated.

PS: For now though this project will stay in a single man's playground state.
